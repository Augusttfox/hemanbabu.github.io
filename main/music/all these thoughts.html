Lyrics:
all these thoughts keep me up at night
what am I doing did I do it right
all these thoughts keep me up at night
I can’t think straight need the light

I need to breathe 
get me up and out of these sheets 
on to my feet,
another cup of coffee in me
that’s what I need
my eyes puffy I can‘t see
I’m too tired to function
buttoo lost to sleep, ay 
I think I need to be on something medication
I think I need to figure out this segregation
I think I needed just a better education
to understand a world that’s so complicated
intoxicated every night faded,
just so I can sleep thinking that it’s aiding
I feel hated
I feel hatred
I’m lost deepinmymind that I’ve created
I have dreams where my life is devastated
feels so real that I wake up shaken
needthickerskin cuz this life is no haven
nod your head, if you get what I’m saying 

all these thoughts keep me up at night
what am I doing did I do it right
all these thoughts keep me up at night
I can’t think straight need the light

I don’t really think I understand this world no
got my head spinning round in a circle
everybody lacks what they need internal
so they compensate with everything external
not trying to throw shade 
no way,
I’m just trying to find the meaning of life hey
there’s happiness if you try to live the right way
forget about what others have and life your life hey
be aware of who you are what your good at
take a step forward see where your foots at
stand tall stand proud
talk loud
every word out your mouth has purpose now
you just gotta get rid of the bad thoughts
hating others cuz you know that they got a lot
forget that tho, you got plenty 
your alive in this life, you got time go get it

all these thoughts keep me up at night
what am I doing did I do it right
all these thoughts keep me up at night
I can’t think straight need the light
