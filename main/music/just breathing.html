LYRICS:

HOOK (2x)
Cuz I’ve been living life right, like I, could just die any minute 
Going for a ride down the side PCH country limit 
I don’t need a guide follow lights take me where I wanna visit
- Are you alive or just breathing 

VERSE 1:
Flashing red lights
Driving at night
Windowless ride  
Feeling alive 
Nothing in sight
Forever in flight
Follow those lines
We’ll make it this time
Blurry street lights
Work as a guide
To memories that we’re making tonight
Oh yea we’re making tonight. 
…..
I’ll do anything that I feel like I wanna do
I’m living life like I got nothing left to prove
No end in sight just always staying on the move
I’ll go all night if that’s just what I gotta do 
……
PRE:
Life’s too short
To care about what you can’t afford
Memories are in what you explore
So just don’t be ignored, go ask for more, go ask for more 

HOOK (2x)
Cuz I’ve been living life right, like I, could just die any minute 
Going for a ride down the side PCH country limit 
I don’t need a guide follow lights take me where I wanna visit
- Are you alive or just breathing 

VERSE 2:
I’m in a race that everybody’s chasing fast
They wanna be that someone on the screen at last
They ain’t looking inside for their needs in life
They wanna be liked by everybody in sight
But trust me being free aint spotlights 
No it’s long nights
And it’s long fights
With yourself all the time to get your mind right
But if you put in the work you can find the light alright??
…..
I’ll do anything that I feel like I wanna do
I’m living life like I got nothing left to prove
no end in sight just always staying on the move
I’ll go all night if that’s just what I gotta do 
……
PRE:
Life’s too short
To care about what you can’t afford
Memories are in what you explore
So just don’t be ignored, go ask for more, go ask for more 

HOOK (2x)
Cuz I’ve been living life right, like I, could just die any minute 
Going for a ride down the side PCH country limit 
I don’t need a guide follow lights take me where I wanna visit
- Are you alive or just breathing
