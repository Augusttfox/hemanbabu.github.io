LYRICS:

Losing time, I’m fading fast
I just wanna make it last
Try to let go of the past
I close my eyes, embrace the black
Sleepless nights and headaches stack
Restlessness to hell and back
What’s my purpose, what do I grab?
A slippery surface, a heart attack
 
And sometimes you just gotta believe
There’s something that’ll give you relief
There’s something that’ll have what you need
 
We’re broken
It’s tragic
We’re not all elastic
But maybe there’s magic
Believe you could have it
And I know of sadness
The anxious and panic
The infinite vastness
Of all that is blackness
 
Chorus (2x):
So tell me oh will you believe
So tell me oh will you believe
So tell me oh will you believe
So tell me oh will you believe!
 
Chorus (2x):
So tell me oh will you believe
So tell me oh will you believe
So tell me oh will you believe
So tell me oh will you believe!
