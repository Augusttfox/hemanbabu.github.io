LYRICS

VERSE 1:
I grew up in place
Where they told you what to chase
Told you how to run the race
Every move was on the page
But I didn’t like their way
Had to fight and misbehave
Had to find a way to change
Had to leave to find my way
Caught up in a daydream
I be in my mind up there almost daily
It’s how I pass time no opinions safely
It how I understand what I want in this place see
Cuz everybody wanna tell you bad things
What could go wrong what the fame brings  but
Success is a finicky thing
And if you ain’t sure no it‘ll never be

HOOK: (2x)
I don’t wanna let myself down my self down

VERSE 2:
I will run runaway
I don’t have to plan it
I can go change my fate
You won’t understand it
All alone that’s ok
People I can’t stand them
They don’t want me to change
Keep me where I’m standing
And I don’t want to be where I am
And I want something more take a chance
It could be, possibly my last dance
My last dance

HOOK: (2x)
I don’t wanna let myself down my self down
