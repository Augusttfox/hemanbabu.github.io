LYRICS:

I’ve seen a lot of change
Been through a lot of pain
Some things are not the same
As they were a year ago
But all will be ok
I move on each and every day
The past is where it stays
Way back a year ago
 
I’ve changed for the better this time
I thought I would never be fine
I strive just to say I’m alright
And for the first time in a long time I’m alright
 
I’ve seen a lot of change
Been through a lot of pain
Some things are not the same
As they were a year ago
But all will be ok
I move on each and every day
The past is where it stays
Way back a year ago
 
I ain’t going back I’m not fallin
I push all my chips and call all in
I’ll bet on myself you keep stalling
I hear destiny and it’s callin’
I’ll keep my head up high through the downs and lows
And where I’ll go in life still nobody knows
But imma choose what’s right and take what comes and goes
And ain’t no one in life holdin' me back no more

I’ve seen a lot of change
Been through a lot of pain
Some things are not the same
As they were a year ago
But all will be ok
I move on each and every day
The past is where it stays
Way back a year ago
