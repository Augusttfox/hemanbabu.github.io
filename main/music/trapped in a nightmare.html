Lyrics:
trapped in a nightmare
in my mind everything that I might fear 
and I fight to get by get my mind clear
everything’s picking sides and I’m right here 
I’m running from things that I’ve done in my past
hoping to become someone that can last
get out my way I’m on the attack
got something to say and I’m not holding back
don’t be a little bitch in my way
I’ll say it to your face 
I’d say it to myself and I’ll put you in your place 
and this world is my prey
I kill without a trace
give a fuck what you say 
cuz we’ll do it my way 
make a buck from the pain
not enough I’m insane,
wanna leave a stain
on this world on your brain
you won’t ever be the same
grab the wheel grab the reigns 
gotta talk to yourself scare away all the pain

who are you inside
I’m sick of never feeling quite right
im gonna make a change this time
you better do the same and climb 
are you just a regret
are you always upset
do you need to reset
figure out what’s up next
trust me take a deep breath
everything you’ll forget 
this is now real threat
to every doubt in your head 

I’m sick of the declining mental health
how bout you go help out your fucking self
take control of your life don’t need no one else
it’s about time that we all get help
from ourselves like a fucking shelf
stack the chairs up and find a way to do it all by yourself 
we’re always deferring to somebody else 
the key is to show everybody don’t tell 
my GOD
are we all to blame?
we should feel ashamed 
it drives me insane
it feels like a game 
we all lose and blame
someone else cuz we feel like they rigged the game
but no
ain’t nobody every gonna stop you
put your mind to it nobody will drop you
all the way to the top never stop you
got one life to live so see it right through 

who are you inside
I’m sick of never feeling quite right
im gonna make a change this time
you better do the same and climb 
are you just a regret
are you always upset
do you need to reset
figure out what’s up next
trust me take a deep breath
everything you’ll forget 
this is now real threat
to every doubt in your head
