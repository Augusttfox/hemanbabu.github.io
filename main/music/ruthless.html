LYRICS:

VERSE 1:
Hey kid…
Don’t ever let them get inside your head
They’ll tell you what to do in life instead 
Of everything you know that you could get
Don’t let them guide your life towards regret
I’ll fight for what I love with every breath
My past is filled with things I won’t forget
I use them all to push me to my best 
So treat the worst of times just like a test 

If only I could go back in time
I’d tell myself that everything will end up alright
Just push yourself, test yourself, figure out what you like
Find your limits, don’t be rigid, always work towards a prime
Surround yourself with open minds, people can change your life
A few friends with intent can help you feel alive
Find a passion, take some action, and with a little time
Just be patient, make a statement, try to enjoy your life 

PRE:
…they’ll try to kick you while you're down…
They wanna rise up while you drown…
They wanna fill your head with doubt…
They’re silently scared that you’ll figure it out…
I’ll make it look like I’m losing
Won’t bother hiding my bruises
And when they finally think your wounded
Then it’s your chance to be ruthless! 

*INSTRUMENTAL DROP:
Then it’s your chance to be ruthless! (2x)

VERSE 2:
They don’t wanna see me make it, they don’t wanna see me care
Anytime I make some progress, I can see that they compare
I think everyone’s against me, maybe something in the air
Am I paranoid? I swear a void is forming and they’re scared 
I walk a straight path
Not many can say that…
I like to play fast 
Cross me and there’s payback
You better pray that
I don’t see your face at… 
Any place that I go, I know you hate that
I’ve been doing fine
I’m not wasting any more time 
I live for the fight and the climb
And I think that the pain that’s deep inside is what defines 
…so I won’t give up I’m gon make it to the top
I don’t care what’s in my way I swear I’m never gonna stop
I can fall flat on my face and I swear I will get back up
Cuz I don’t deserve a thing and the road ahead is tough  

PRE:
…they’ll try to kick you while you're down…
They wanna rise up while you drown…
They wanna fill your head with doubt…
They’re silently scared that you’ll figure it out…
I’ll make it look like I’m losing
Won’t bother hiding my bruises
And when they finally think your wounded
Then it’s your chance to be ruthless! 

*INSTRUMENTAL DROP:
Then it’s your chance to be ruthless! (2x)

OUTRO:
I’ll make it look like I’m losing
Won’t bother hiding my bruises
And when they finally think your wounded
Then it’s your chance to be ruthless!
