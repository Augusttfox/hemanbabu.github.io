LYRICS:

HOOK:
I can hear the demons call when they do what they do
And now I feel like taking off, find a place with a view
The pain is never gonna stop if it’s controlling you 
I know that time can heal it all, I just gotta get through 
I just gotta get through! 
I just gotta get through!
Cuz I feel like taking off find a place with a view
The pain is never gonna stop if it’s controlling you 
I know that time can heal it all, I just gotta get through 

VERSE 1: 
Sometimes I feel like all is lost but I know it’s not true 
I wanna put up all my walls cuz I’m not in the mood
But then I cut myself off from the rest of the room
I know that time can heal it all if you're patient and soon…
It can all be worth it 
All the searching 
Pain is never really permanent, but damn it hurts man
I can feel all of the turbulence and it’s concerning
I’ve been searching for a purpose, I hope it’s worth it … 
This society is really trying me
Ain’t no hide and seek, I hide to be far from anxiety
I need my space I need my privacy, I need some silence please 
You're all to loud 
You don’t speak quietly, opinions violently
Thrown across every surface
It makes me nervous
Is the world honestly burning?
That’s all I’m learning
Hope that we can make a turn and
Start reversing 
All our minds and put the work in
We got some work man! 

PRE (2x): 
Ahhhhh 
 I just gotta get through, gotta get through

HOOK:

I just gotta get through! 
I just gotta get through!
Cuz I feel like taking off find a place with a view
The pain is never gonna stop if it’s controlling you 
I know that time can heal it all, I just gotta get through 
I just gotta get through 

VERSE 2:
…gotta get through this
Life is a nuisance
Tie up some loose ends…
I try to be human
Find a solution
My evolution
A place like this
It didn’t Exist
We made it like this 
So you can go pick
The bad or the good gotta glass half which? 
And I know
It’s easier to hide and just to lay low
Not everyone in life has got a halo
I’m standing in the rain inside a payphone
Just wanna break no
I’m NOT gonna give in
Take a last SHOT Michael J win
No I’m not a robot I’m in my own skin
Never get lost when thoughts pull you in
“I miss the old you” 
He died with a purpose 
All the energy around me felt nervous
Scared I would pop off rise to the surface 
Had to cut it off before you made me worthless 
Torn apart, I’ve been torn and scarred 
I had a giving heart, but now I’m thinking smart 
I’m keeping up my guard 
I’m hiding every card 
A royal flush or bluff you’ll never know it’s art… 
With a back to the mat
Gonna see where I’m at
Imma fight like I’m mad
I’m a be something that
They could never be me, nice try 
But they’ll see I achieve everything while they stay salty

PRE (2x): 
Ahhhhh 
 I just gotta get through, gotta get through

HOOK:
I can hear the demons call when they do what they do
And now I feel like taking off, find a place with a view

I just gotta get through! 
I just gotta get through!
Cuz I feel like taking off find a place with a view
The pain is never gonna stop if it’s controlling you 
I know that time can heal it all, I just gotta get through 
I just gotta get through
