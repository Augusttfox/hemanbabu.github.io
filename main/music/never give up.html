Lyrics:
my hands steady
I feel ready
but my legs heavy
I don't get it
how come I haven't hit it
already
still working
I'm still learning
I'm still searching
finally earning something 
finally turning something
called a profit
if I hear you talkin shit
dont get caught in it 
I'll be poppin off and hit
ya ass dropping all your shit
yea I promise this
I got promises
you ain't stopping this 
cross my shit
you'll be knocked unconscious bitch
that's the consequence 
I got this 
I will not quit
man im on it
honest
I'm gon launch quick
then I'm gone it's
just a matter of time
before I'm over the climb
and moving onto my prime
just quit my 9 to 5
I'm rocking
and they watching
cuz it's shocking
dropping 
all these top ten
songs no stopping
it's time to live my life
it's time to live not die
wish I could slow down time
and just enjoy the climb

yea I'm the one to get it bruh
I swear to god I'll get it bruh
and I ain't never giving up...
yea I never give up

I got this
man I got it
I will not quit
I'm on it
never off it 
got the block lit

I'm toxic
spitting logic
make em nauseous
honest
cannot stop this
never cautious

drop it
I'm the hottest 
knock knock bitch
watch it.....
I'm the fucking king of rock bitch

prophet
spittin hot shit
off topic
chronic....
I think I've mother fucking lost it

take it back
matter fact
making racks
where it's at
had my back
to the mat
not an act
that's a fact

we attack
in a pack
dont react
no we act
think I'm blacked
off this jack
while I rap
bout to snap

throw a jab
give a crap
where it lands
I'm the man
got a plan
better than
most brands
god damn

Ima rhyme
till I die
never lie
that's a lie
I don't try
I defy
can't deny
that I'm right
chyea!

I've been in and out the studio
like a student tho
working on a movement yea I'll do it
cuz I'm in the zone
and you know
that I'm ready for the shows
how it goes 
I don't know
but I'm waiting till I'm chose
front row
here I go
all these people want to know
what you think of them lately 
do you really love me or do you really hate me
on a scale of one to ten what would you grade me
all this social media has got me going crazy
lately
everything's inflated
mainly
everyone's invaded
privacy is naked
man I really hate it
god I really hate it
I just wanna make it
through all this fake shit
livin in the real life
livin for some real times
talk about the real climb
passionate and real rhymes
steal time
back from my 9 to 5 
takin back my fuckin life
I just wanna feel alive

yea I'm the one to get it bruh
I swear to god I'll get it bruh
and I ain't never giving up...
yea I never give up

fake it till I make it
mother fuckin take it
take it back from these 
haters playin tracks for the traitors
got the passion
and that's when 
it happens 
factions
take action 
drafting
their captains
it's happening

I'm raising my status
facing the madness
I'm out gaining traction
avoiding distractions

I'm snapping
no captions
attracting
reactions
adapting 
attacking
commanding
the masses

practicing habits
I don't fuckin ask bitch
I just fuckin grab it
i am never static

massively
active
expanding...
that's lit
planning
to have it
so I will go capture it

and Ima stay after it
I'm gon fuckin master it
put em on blast kid
they will never last kid!

don't be so dramatic
not my demographic
this shit is democratic
they vote NEFFEX yea bitch!
