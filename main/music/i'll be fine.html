I swear that I’ll be fine yea
Lookin for a sign yea
Always in my mind I’ve been losing track of time
Man I miss when I was 9 yea
Everything was fine yea
Think I’ll be alright I just need you by my side
But I swear that I’ll be fine yea
Lookin for a sign yea
Always in my mind I’ve been losing track of time
Man I miss when I was 9 yea
Everything was fine yea
Swear I’ll be alright I just need you by my side

I’ve been through some harder days
Things that I’ve let get away
I’m just sick of feeling things
Don’t know what forever brings
I’ve been losing everything
I’m my own worst enemy
Feeling like I’ll never be
Anything I wanna be
I’ve been through some changes
Hope to rearrange it
Flippin through the pages
Playing different stages
Everything I’m chasing
Don’t know why I’m chasing
Leave without a trace and
Still don’t know my place yea

Lately I’ve been thinking maybe I can just be alright
Find something I love and maybe I can make my own light
I can get it just right
If I can get it just right

I swear that I’ll be fine yea
Lookin for a sign yea
Always in my mind I’ve been losing track of time
Man I miss when I was 9 yea
Everything was fine yea
Think I’ll be alright I just need you by my side
But I swear that I’ll be fine yea
Lookin for a sign yea
Always in my mind I’ve been losing track of time
Man I miss when I was 9 yea
Everything was fine yea
Swear I’ll be alright I just need you by my side

I know I know
This life it gets crazy
Had those little moments I never thought I would make it

Had to take my thoughts, and figure out how to change them
All the bad ones eventually I erased them
Had to take my mind and figure out how to own it
Everything designed to make my life how I want it
Now I’m doing fine I plan to keep it all going
Now I’m doing fine I plan to keep it all growing

Lately I’ve been thinking maybe I can just be alright
Find something I love and maybe I can make my own light
I can get it just right
If I can get it just right

I swear that I’ll be fine yea
Lookin for a sign yea
Always in my mind I’ve been losing track of time
Man I miss when I was 9 yea
Everything was fine yea
Think I’ll be alright I just need you by my side
But I swear that I’ll be fine yea
Lookin for a sign yea
Always in my mind I’ve been losing track of time
Man I miss when I was 9 yea
Everything was fine yea
