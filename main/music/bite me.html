LYRICS:

Ain’t no mother fucker in this world can do it like me
Open up your eyes and insert a little visine
You don’t have to love me you don’t have to like me
Got enough love in myself in my psyche
You should have the same in your brain nightly
If you want a taste bitch, you can fucking try me
If you wanna hate bitch, you know where to find me
And if you go and hate this, you can fucking bite me
 
I be cruising in my lane fast call it high speed
I’ve been working hard yeah, I’ve been working nightly
If you think you’ll win, ha, not fucking likely
I be taking shots yeah, cold-blooded icy
Watchin’ numbers grow is what I call sightseeing
In the front row, run it up when they hype me
The following grows, they know how to ignite me
Call me CEO, I’ve been running shit right see
 
And I ain’t playing games
I create my own lane
Making pleasure out of pain
 
Turning losses into gains
I’m the boss of making change
I’ve been rocking this exchange
 
Poppin’ off and risking things
Gonna make a fucking name
I just wanna be famous...
 
Nut I don’t want that cheap fame
No I’m not that vain
I just wanna be greatness
 
Ain’t no mother fucker in this world can do it like me
Open up your eyes and insert a little visine
You don’t have to love me you don’t have to like me
Got enough love in myself in my psyche
You should have the same in your brain nightly
If you want a taste bitch, you can fucking try me
If you wanna hate bitch, you know where to find me
And if you go and hate this, you can fucking bite me
 
Ok, I’m going off every chance I get
I don’t really take a loss well I’ll admit
That's why I’ll make it to the top, yeah I commit
And no I’m never getting lost, I get after it
Investing in my own stock, cuz it’s faster than
Any crypto hits go let me spend
Everything that you see is something I invent
And it’s only a percent
 
I’m gonna take shots
If I miss I’ll forget it
I’ll take a fat loss just to learn all that’s in it
I’m takin snapshots learning how to fall and get it
I’m getting back up always stand tall don’t sweat it
I never back up
I don’t miss a thing or regret it
I’m always learning you could call me academic
I’m always working never been apathetic
Bad energy is like poison need some antiseptic

Ain’t no mother fucker in this world can do it like me
Open up your eyes and insert a little visine
You don’t have to love me you don’t have to like me
Got enough love in myself in my psyche
You should have the same in your brain nightly
If you want a taste bitch, you can fucking try me
If you wanna hate bitch, you know where to find me
And if you go and hate this, you can fucking bite me
