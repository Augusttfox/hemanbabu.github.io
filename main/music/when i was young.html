Lyrics
VERSE 1:
I’ve been looking all around
try to figure out what the hell really counts
when everything feels like it’s fillin up with doubt
thoughts heading south
and no one can hear me shout
and the voices in my head so loud
calm before the storm like a Seattle cloud
the sky so gray try to figure it out
why I’m so down in this sunlight drought
yea memories coming back to me
of a simpler time when I was young and free
playing games with the kids lived next to me
didn’t care about time or anything yea
but things Change turned twenty three
had to figure out what the hell was next for me
do I do the safe thing something guaranteed
or do I do what I love till my fingers bleed

PRE:
it’ll all be ok
figure out my own way
but for now here I lay
and remember a day
when I was young
when I was young

VERSE 2:
smoke stacks cuz it’s Cold outside
fire burning from the other night
I can smell the coals in my soul it makes me feel something deep inside
memories of a better life
memories where I felt alive
in these time you can choose to survive
in these times you can choose to thrive
and I wanna make something take something
take control of my life and display something
show the world what I love and go play something
show the world what I love on a stage strumming
and I wanna make y’all feel the same
and I wanna take away all the pain
at least for a minute while I play
I wanna make you feel ok

PRE:
it’ll all be ok
figure out my own way
but for now here I lay
and remember a day
when I was young
when I was young
