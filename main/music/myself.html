Lyrics: 
they say life will bring discomfort
and I discovered
we all just suffer
cuz no one feels that bad
and it comes from one another
we hurt each other 
just like a lover
and dont think twice bout that

I feel like somethings bad
but hell im used to that
I always turn my back
yea
and I wanna feel something
but all I feel is pain
I wanna make a change bad

you either pick yourself up
or you let yourself down
life will always be tough
so who the fuck are you now
will you make it alone
or do you need someone else
I don’t need anyone
I’ll do it all by myself 

i got scars 
put up my guard 
I don’t wanna get torn apart 
I start 
to feel my heart
race faster it’s pumping hard 

and all I want is to be something
that’s why I just keep on running
can’t stop what you don’t see coming...
and you know I’m coming

how can I trust you
if you don’t trust me
I do what I do 
cuz it is just me
and nothing is new
no I’m not lucky
I work my ass off
so I’ll be something 

you either pick yourself up
or you let yourself down
life will always be tough
so who the fuck are you now
will you make it alone
or do you need someone else
I don’t need anyone
I’ll do it all by myself
