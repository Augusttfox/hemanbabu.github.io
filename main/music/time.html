LYRICS

Verse 1:
I’m so sorry
for the pain that I cause
can’t retract these claws
once they’re out
you can’t stop me 
I’m destructive and cocky
till I fall like a jockey
off my high horse and back to nothing 
got these scars all from me trusting
and they bleed can’t stop the flooding
when I open them back up I know it’s disgusting 
trust me.
and I work every day
just to hear them say
that it’s not enough
that I’m not enough
I should just give up 
half empty cup
in my mind ugh
thoughts hold me down
I keep fighting drown
screaming out so loud
can you hear me now?!
can you hear me now?!
no response a drought
from a silent mouth
the harsh sound of doubt

Hook:
Hear that sound 
soft yet loud
I just feel like I’ve been running out
of time, of time, of time, of time (3x)

Verse 2:
I don’t want
to wake up
everything
just aches yuh
feels like a break up
no time to make up 
life just keeps on changing
and I want to rearrange it
but it feels so out of my control
my energy just keeps on draining
but I push back these demons 
in my mind all of these heathens
serotonin seasons
and maybe that’s the reason
that I’m open like a lesion
and my minds committing treason  
and my souls the only beacon
I keep on fighting all these demons yea 

Hook:
Hear that sound 
soft yet loud
I just feel like I’ve been running out
of time, of time, of time, of time (3x)

Bridge:
It feels like I’m lost 
and I’m drowning (4x)
I can’t stop 
what I can’t control
it keeps moving and I’m growing old (2x)
(It feels like I’m lost, and I’m drowning (8x) )
(I can’t stop what I can’t control, it keeps moving and I’m growing old (4x) )

Outro:
I don’t know man
