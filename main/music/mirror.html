Lyrics:

Verse 1:
no, can’t keep me down
lost in my thoughts feel like I could drown
oh no can’t have it now
buried so deep im below the ground 
I go, where I hear the sound
all on my own I can feel it now
unknown, so my heart pounds
cuz I don’t understand what happens now
oh no 
I Rest In Peace
leave behind a lesser me
working hard to better me
looking back I’ll never be 
lets go!
recklessly
fighting to forget it’s me
I feel inside it’s festering
but I just want a better me 

chorus:
and your the one that let me down
I’m looking at myself right now
the mirror nearly breaks itself 
I’m screaming out cuz I need help 

Verse 2:
i try to forget
you held me back, soon as we met
you were always scared of what happens next
unprepared so you feared regret
I’m upset
cuz I wasted time
I sat at the base when I should’ve climbed
i stopped with the chase and forgot the grind 
I feel out of place empty inside 
you thought
I’d never be
won’t amount to anything 
had me doubting everything
you only new a lesser me
your now
my enemy
wish you never met with me
work until the death of me 
so I become a better me

chorus:
and your the one that let me down
I’m looking at myself right now
the mirror nearly breaks itself 
I’m screaming out cuz I need help
