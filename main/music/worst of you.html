LYRICS:

CHORUS:
I’m losing sight
of what is right
I’m hoping the worst of you brings out the best in me
and thru the night
you never see my side
so I’m hoping the worst of you brings out the best in me

VERSE:
your quiet yet your actions are so loud
you don’t even have to open your mouth
your aggressive without having to shout
just let it out just let it out
I’m so tired from these sleepless nights
you make me feel like I do nothing right
I can’t even open my eyes, I’m so tired, I’m so tired now

PRE:
so call me blind
and throw my phone
leave my side I’ll be alone
I hate to fight but won’t be gone
you’re the one that I still want

CHORUS:
I’m losing sight
of what is right
I’m hoping the worst of you brings out the best in me
and thru the night
you never see my side
so I’m hoping the worst of you brings out the best in me

VERSE 2:
in these times I miss what we had
just yesterday I was making you laugh
how did things get so bad?
how do I make you so mad?
I look at you and I miss what I’ve seen
a smile so bright with your eyes so green
and I’ll wait for the day it comes back to me
I’ll wait for the day it comes back to me

CHORUS:
I’m losing sight
of what is right
I’m hoping the worst of you brings out the best in me
and thru the night
you never see my side
so I’m hoping the worst of you brings out the best in me
