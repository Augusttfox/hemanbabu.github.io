Lyrics:

Verse 1:

I'm gunna roll in a benz hey
pull up on chicks that a 10 hey
parties on weekends I'm bent hey
all of this money is spent hey

throwin a lot of events hey
throw em for me and my friends hey
turn up a 100 percent hey
livin until I am dead hey

I'm gunna make it you'll see trick
give it some time and you'll see this
I don't just want it I need it 
that is why I will achieve it

Man U just gotta believe it
see in your mind you can be it
live every day with no regret
makin mistakes and then reset

go on and hate me
because I do what I do
go on and hate me
cuz I got nothing to prove
go on and hate me
cuz I got nothing to lose
go on and hate me
go on and hate me

but that's okay
I cannot complain
because today
I'm doing my thang
I stay my lane
and fight through the pain
so that one day
I can make a name yea

Pre:
I can do this all day
i can hear em all hate
don't care what they all say
I'm gon do it my way
got em like woah
I got em like woah
got em like woah
I got em like woah
yea

I want it all so I'll get it one day
I will not fall till I've made it on stage
won't stop at all till I've gotten a name
I will stand tall and face all in my way

Verse 2:

and I stay true to the beat yuh
rapping like I came from the streets nah
rappin like I want something yuh
rapping all about my beliefs yuh

rappin like you can't stop me na
everybody knows what I need yuh
hurts every time that I see yuh
need a couple aspirin to sleep yuh

Ima get big Ima be lit
y'all gunna hear about what I did
Ima get huge Ima be rich
cuz I fill that void like I'm fillin up a niche

and I'm never gunna give up
hit em with a little bit of switch up
never gon be able to predict us
gunna be the ones with the hits bruh
get lit yuh

go on and hate me
because I'm better than you 
go on and hate me
because I'm making my move
go on and hate me
because I know what to do
go on and hate me
go on and hate me

but that's okay
I cannot complain
because today
I'm doing my thang
I stay my lane
and fight through the pain
so that one day
I can make a name yea

Pre:
I can do this all day
i can hear em all hate
don't care what they all say
I'm gon do it my way
got em like woah
I got em like woah
got em like woah
I got em like woah
yea

I want it all so I'll get it one day
I will not fall till I've made it on stage
won't stop at all till I've gotten a name
I will stand tall and face all in my way
