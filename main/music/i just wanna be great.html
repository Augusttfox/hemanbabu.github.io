LYRICS:

VERSE 1:
Searching for greatness
In a sea of the dying and shameless
A sea of the aimless
I don’t want to be one of the nameless
Imma wake up with the mindset that one day I’m gonna make it
And I don’t think I’ll be fine if I don’t break my limitations
Don’t try to stop me
I exist to write my own story
I’ll make a decision if I want some peace or if I want the glory
I don’t want a life that is complacent or possibly boring
I just want a life that is worth every day exploring…

HOOK:
My whole life I just wanted someone who would notice me
My whole life I just wanted to be somebody to be

(2x)
Yeah I just wanna be great
I just wanna be great
I just wanna be great

VERSE 2:
This is a statement
To appreciate all that is vacant
It’s yours for the taking
If you make up your mind you can take it
I’m never complacent
I would work in a mansion or basement yea
There’s no replacement
For persistence and some patience
In this life
I wanna be soaring
To feel sun inside when it’s pouring
And I’ll fight till anxiety is foreign
I’m so sick of my minds extortion

HOOK:
My whole life I just wanted someone who would notice me
My whole life I just wanted to be somebody to be

(2x)
Yeah I just wanna be great
I just wanna be great
I just wanna be great
