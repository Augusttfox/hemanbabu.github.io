Lyrics: 
Verse 1:
gotta get it
know I gotta get it
got the sun setting fast cuz the winter always winning
and I’m so sick of class always feeling like I’m in it 
my mistakes never pass going back to the beginning 
uh
I steal eyes, thats my prize
and to my Surprise,
 a milli came to my side 
cuz they recognize that all I do is try 
and I ain’t gonna hide what I got inside uh

put my mind in a cast
cuz it’s broke from past
good things never last 
bad things get a pass 
got scars on my back
from the scratch in the past 
if I got nothing left
then what’s left shouldn’t last
if a life is so vast
then we shouldn’t waste that
keep your head up pick urself off the mat
and you gotta fight back
make a name make it fast
make a change that’ll last 
and the pains just a fad 

pre:
hold me down
I’ll still make it 
I won’t be left out
a good time is waiting
and I’ll make me proud
just as time is fading
I’ll look back and doubt
that my time was wasted 

HOOK:
hold me down
I’ll still make it 
I won’t be left out
a good time is waiting
and I’ll make me proud
just as time is fading
I’ll look back and doubt
that my time was wasted 

I’m here to stay
I’m here to stay

Verse 2:

the ticket man
is to listen man uh
win a hand 
that you didn’t plan uh 
the vision can
give a better chance uh
and I land on my feet I stand up
never gonna give up 
till my dreams real
never gonna give up 
till I’m a big deal
never gonna give up
till I can heal
others who are giving up
in the real world 
I don’t wanna feel hate In side
I would rather try to live than die
I would rather tell the truth not lie
that way I got nothing to hide 
i ain’t never gonna let me down
would rather face fears than a lesser me now
staring back in the mirror like you could’ve been proud 
oh hell naw, ima make it somehow 

pre:
hold me down
I’ll still make it 
I won’t be left out
a good time is waiting
and I’ll make me proud
just as time is fading
I’ll look back and doubt
that my time was wasted 

HOOK:
hold me down
I’ll still make it 
I won’t be left out
a good time is waiting
and I’ll make me proud
just as time is fading
I’ll look back and doubt
that my time was wasted 

I’m here to stay
I’m here to stay
