Lyrics:

Verse 1:
I needed something
someone to trust in
I needed something
to get me through this life
never saw you coming
and now we’re just running yea
you make me feel nothing
when we’re driving through the night
I’ve been looking all around at the places
you and I were seeing so many different faces
we’re just cruising right on through this life with a playlist
and everything is right
never really thought I would make it
found someone who I don’t think I’ll ever replace and
I’m emptying my heart so, you can just take it
im living my best life

HOOK:
and I feel so alive
with you by my side
we can make a life
I’ve got nothing to hide
driving so fast
every town passed
never look back
we’re good at that
cuz I feel so alive
damn you look good tonight

Verse 2:
we’re driving through rain riding through sun and looking at plains
we’re cruising through towns moving all around but you stay the same
we like to runaway we’re ditching all our pain and living for today
we’re driving so fast wanna make it last we’ll do it our way
and I feel good at night
full moon the only light
you make me feel like
I’m doing alright
I feel good inside
maybe a little high
you make me feel like
everything will be alright

HOOK: x2
and I feel so alive
with you by my side
we can make a life
I’ve got nothing to hide
driving so fast
every town passed
never look back
we’re good at that
cuz I feel so alive
damn you look good tonight
