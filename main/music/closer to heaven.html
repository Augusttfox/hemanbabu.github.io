LYRICS
Pain
Cuz it’ll never be the same
This world will just forget your name 
But I will never be the same
Why
Is there just an end to life
I hope that it feels alright
I hope that the end is nice

I don’t understand it
I don’t know who planned it
I can’t seem to handle all the memories and change 
I don’t understand it
I know I can’t stand this
I hate knowing nothing, will ever be the same

Are you closer to heaven
Are you closer to heaven
Do you think I’ll be let in
Tell me are you closer to heaven 
Cuz I need time! (x2)

I’ve seen so many places and faces from chasing a dream that no one 
said i could have
But none can replace or take away all the days and memories that
we once had

Are you closer to heaven
Are you closer to heaven
Do you think I’ll be let in
Tell me are you closer to heaven 
Cuz I need time!

I’m not alright
I don’t feel fine
I’m sick of watching everybody age with time
