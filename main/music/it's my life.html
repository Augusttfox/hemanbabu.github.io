Lyrics:
[INTRO]
it’s my life
so I’ll do want I want to
and I’ll get what I want to
woah
cuz it’s my life
I’ll get high if I want to
live my life how I want to
woah woah! 

[VERSE]
yea,
got my life in my hands
I’ve been running all around but I ain’t got any plans
all the homies cruise around and we just packed in a van
hitting every single town where we know all of the fans uh 
woah girl
what you running from now
 I could tell that she was looking for a hell of a time 
I just wanna take her back now
I just wanna take her back now
woah oh oh oh oh 
she got those moves 
that everybody wanna see
and she like that groove
and got me begging baby please
it’s just me and you 
I like this view ok ok ok oh 
I don’t wanna wait
for a good time
so I’m gonna make 
us a good time 
we can fake it or make it just take it now uh
we can shake it and break it just let it out oh! 

[HOOK]
it’s my life
so I’ll do want I want to
and I’ll get what I want to
woah
cuz it’s my life
I’ll get high if I want to
live my life how I want to
woah woah! 

[VERSE 2]
summer nights when we put on a show 
anybody wanna come and anybody can go
cranking up the energy with an old radio
and she saying baby please can we do it some more
hmm
ok guess we doing this thing
round 2 and she’s cute and I don’t know her name
in the middle of the room spilling all her champagne
shaking hips cherry lips and a tight little frame
ay
ok ok tho 
yea tear it up tornado 
uh do you wanna play a game tho
yea molding bodies like it’s playdoe
uh damn 
it’s a hell of a thing
watch her hips move around as the melody sings
like a kid crushing now as I see them they swing
I just wanna pull her in like a fish on a string  

[HOOK]
it’s my life
so I’ll do want I want to
and I’ll get what I want to
woah
cuz it’s my life
I’ll get high if I want to
live my life how I want to
woah woah! 

[DROP HOOK]
it’s my life
so I’ll do want I want to
and I’ll get what I want to
woah
cuz it’s my life
I’ll get high if I want to
live my life how I want to
woah woah! x2
