LYRICS:

Verse 1:
I’ve been dreaming on
In my head like ive seen it
A life worth living is a life with meaning
I’ll do what I love till my heart stops beating
I’m feeding this demon
Gotta taste can’t erase bitterness in my face
Work a job every day till your dreams fade away 
Like a cog never change play the game how we say
I need a break

Hook: 
I’m staying strong
Need to move on
To be what I want
I’ll keep dreaming on
I’m staying strong
Need to move on
To be what I want
I’ll keep dreaming on

I wanna be someone
I wanna be great
I'm gonna be someone
It’s never to late

Verse 2:
Game face on when I chase like that
Yeah I play so strong with a knife in the back 
Imma swing home run like a baseball bat
Gonna see me rise you gon hate on that 
I don’t play both sides doing me no cap 
Imma ride or die for my dreams on tap
Imma fly real high you ain’t seen me slack
No it’s not how you fall it’s how you get right back
Up 
That’s how you get tough
Calluses on my hands so rough
Yeah I’ll call your bluff
I'm not the one
Mess with me and come out with none
Cuz I’m so done
You had your fun 
And now you gonna face down the barrel of the gun 
Cuz I gotta full clip
With your name on it
But imma let you slide cuz you ain’t worth it

Hook: 
I’m staying strong
Need to move on
To be what I want
I’ll keep dreaming on
I’m staying strong
Need to move on
To be what I want
I’ll keep dreaming on

I wanna be someone
I wanna be great
I'm gonna be someone
it’s never too late
