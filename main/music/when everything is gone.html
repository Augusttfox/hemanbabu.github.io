Lyrics: 
verse 1:
it’s you against the world
better figure out fast
who the hell you can trust
if you wanna make it pass
all the fakes and the lust
better figure out fast
na this ain’t what you want
you don’t want it that bad
can you give up all your stuff
pay attention to the facts
and forget the media
figure out your own path
can you figure out love
or, do you feel wrath 
can you hone that feeling
and create an impact 

go get it
if you want it go get
get with it
ain’t nobody gon give it
yo ticket
gonna take a quick minute
don’t quit it
figure out your own limit
life is a test the best make progress figure out what is next and carve a path yes
no they never second guess take a chance no regret if you want it take a breath give your blood and your sweat

pre:
...when everything just breaks
from all of your mistakes
don’t let yourself feel down
don’t let yourself just drown 
only when youve lost everything
are you free to do anything...
and then when you lost everything
you lose the chains that let you free’ 

hook:
And when every thing is gone
and you’re feeling all alone
don’t let life get you down
you can figure it out x2

Verse 2:
I’m a sick nut
I like a quick buck
wanna know what
I’m bout to blow up
caffeine in my cup
not lean in the blood
on the scene like a flood
and I’ve been through the mud
no I cant get enough
like challenge make it tough...
no it’s not a bluff
cuz I live for this stuff
and I take off the gloves
just to break all my nucks 
when I’m down on my luck
pick myself back up

heavy hitter
and you know I’m not a quitter
no beginner 
gonna be a steady winner
maybe sinner
every time I rhyme it’s killer 
what’s for dinner
bout to be the breadwinner...
no cake cuz it’s not my birthday
it’s a workday everyday’s a thirst day
man I’m thirsty for the grind and the word play
you can’t hurt me cuz I already hurt me 

pre:
...when everything just breaks
from all of your mistakes
don’t let yourself feel down
don’t let yourself just drown 
only when youve lost everything
are you free to do anything...
and then when you lost everything
you lose the chains that let you free’ 

hook:
And when every thing is gone
and you’re feeling all alone
don’t let life get you down
you can figure it out x2
